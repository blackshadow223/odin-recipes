        <h1>Chicken and Noodles</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            This easy, one-pot dish is comfort in a bowl. Made with leftover chicken and vegetables you probably have on
            hand, it's ready in just half an hour. Boiling the chicken and vegetables makes a delicious stock, and the
            chicken tenderizes even more as the egg noodles cook in the broth. The noodles' starchiness adds a smooth
            consistency that's made even more velvety with a pat of butter. (Add more butter to make it even creamier.)
            Whatever you choose, this inexpensive, cozy dinner is easy to love.

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To a large pot, add stock, celery, onion, garlic, adobo and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Bring to a boil
                over high heat and continue to boil until the vegetables are soft, about 9 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add egg noodles and enough water to cover. Cook noodles according to package directions, until al dente.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add chicken and cook until meat is heated through. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed.
                Finish with butter and parsley, if you like.
