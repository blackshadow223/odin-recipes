This is my first TOP Project where I am supposed to test my knowledge of HTML that I have learned over time with
The Odin Project. At the time of writing this, I haven't even started yet. But I intend to provide some of the details
of when I run into problems here after I have finished the project, for self-reflection.


### Time for self-reflection:
This project was not that big of a challenge really. It was pretty simple to make. The real problem was using git though.
I am completely knew to git, and this project was the first time using it. And I'd say, git was easy.
The commits though? Yeah... that's what's making me feel really bad about this project. I feel like I didn't commit often enough
to be acceptable. "Just 4 commits and the whole project is done?" goes my brain. Yes, the project was really simple, but
still... it's kinda bothering me. Anyway, as I tackle other projects, I hope that I'll get better.

**Note**: *This self-reflection thing is meant for me to check my progress, might feel kinda silly... can't do anything about it.*
